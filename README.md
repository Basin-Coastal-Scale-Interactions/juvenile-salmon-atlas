"Stock-specific marine distribution patterns of juvenile Chinook salmon reveal a gradient of migratory strategies during their first year at sea"
====

This repository contains all required data and code to replicate the analyses
used in the manuscript titled "Stock-specific marine distribution patterns 
of juvenile Chinook salmon reveal a gradient of migratory strategies during 
their first year at sea".
It includes files to fit spatiotemporal models of seasonal abundance for 
Chinook, chum, coho, pink and sockeye salmon
(`R/01_fitting_species_wide_models.R`, although only the abundance estimates
for Chinook salmon are used in the manuscript), and the 
stock composition spatiotemporal model using GSI samples for Chinook salmon 
(`R/06_fitting_stock_comp_sdmRMB.R`). 
The data files needed to fit these  models are already stored in this repo, 
so models can be fitted without having to run any other code. 
All analyses files are in the `R/` folder and are numbered in the order they 
should be run, so for running any other files, source them 
sequentially.

Data sources not generated by this repo are stored in `data-raw/`, while
data sources created by this repo are stored in `data/`.
Most files in `data/` are created when running the code here and are not
being version tracked, as they are often extremely large files (700MB+), 
with the exception of the following three small files 
to help speed up running this code by skipping some time-consuming steps:

- `data/chinook_gsi_counts.rds`: Cleaned Chinook salmon GSI data. Allows running `R/06_fitting_stock_comp_sdmTMB.R` without needing to run previous files.
- `data/cleaned_atlas_catch_dat.rds`: Cleaned catch data, allows running `R/00_predictive_grid_whole_coast.R` and `R/01_fitting_species_wide_models.R` straight away
- `data/rot_centre.rds`: Centre of maps for map rotation. Needed for most instances of map plotting.
