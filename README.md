Seasonal stock-specific patterns in distribution and abundance of juvenile 
 Chinook salmon (*Oncorhynchus tshawytscha*) in British Columbia, Canada
====

This repository contains all required files to fit spatiotemporal models
of seasonal abundance for chinook, chum, coho, pink and sockeye
(`R/01_fitting_species_wide_models.R`), and the 
stock composition spatiotemporal model using GSI samples for chinook 
(`R/06_fitting_stock_comp_sdmRMB.R`). The data files needed to fit these 
models are already stored in this repo, so models can be fitted without
having to run any other code. For running any other files, source them 
sequentially.

Analysis files are in the `R/` folder and are numbered in the order they 
should be run.

Data sources not generated by this repo are stored in `data-raw/`, while
data sources created by this repo are stored in `data/`.
